Gimp-ScriptFu-Client version 1.01 - first public release
========================================================

Gimp::ScriptFu::Client acts as a source filter in a Scheme
script that uses Text::Template to preprocess any embedded
Perl fragments contained between { } brackets before sending
the resulting Scheme to a Gimp Script-Fu server. Each Perl
fragment may or may not produce a Scheme fragment.

The Scheme script becomes a standalone client application.

This permits using Perl for getting parameters from the real world
or for generating complex Scheme expressions, that would be more
difficult or impossible with plain Scheme.

It also makes it possible to do Perlish things with Gimp if you
can't do the compiler stuff for Gimp/Gimp::Fu for your OS. All
recent Gimp versions include the Script-Fu (Scheme) server.

Tested with Gimp 2.13.12 and Gimp 2.13.14, compiled with MinGW
on Win XP, Perl 5.8.8
